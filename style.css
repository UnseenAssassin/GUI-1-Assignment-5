Gui Assignment: Scrabble with drag and drop
Description: This file is responsible for the tiles, the tile holder and the tile board for the scrabble game.  It is responsible for the size,
shape, and the dimensions of those objects.  This file also centeres everything and makes everything neat so the user can clearly see
where they are able to place the tile and see their score based on the word they have out down.
